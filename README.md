# Google-dino-game
This modification to the dinosaur game is thanks to the OpenCV library of python. As much fun as this project was, a word of advice, the code for this project is fickle.

The main idea behind the project is that your camera will register, frame by frame, the specific hand movement and gestures made by you. It will look specifically for surfaces that look like your skin ie. match its color. So it's advised to wear full sleeves and sit in a neutral background while executing the code.

This all might sound too complicated to you, but trust me when I say, that it's worth the effort. A youtube video will soon follow explaining how exactly to execute the code and make use of it.

It all boils down to this-

    1. Open this code in one tab of your favourite browser.
    
    2. Open another tab and navigate to the dino game by google:- chrome://dino.
    
    3. Execute the code and wait for the camera to start recoding.
    
    4. As and when the camera records, select the dino game tab and make sure that your hand is inside the big green rectangle.
    
    5. Anything that looks like your skin inside of the big green rectangle will be registered by your camera. 
    
    6. Opening your fists will make the dino jump and clench your fists as soon as the dino completes its jump.
    
 A word of advice:-
     This project takes quite a bit of time to implement and works differently for diferent situations. This is because your skin colour may change on camera depending on the lighting condition of the room and maybe many more factors. This means it would take much toil and labour before you can get this working for you. But it will be rewarding in the end, I can assure you that.
